# RT-Artix-Linux-BSPWM-Files-Dotfiles-Edition-II

This Repository contains the Configuration Files and various other relevant stuff related to my Artix Linux/BSPWM Configuration. This is the IInd Edition of my BSPWM rice.

Based on the suggestions from friends. I switched the colour schemes to a more relaxing and less intimidating one. Font colours may still be changed accordingly.
